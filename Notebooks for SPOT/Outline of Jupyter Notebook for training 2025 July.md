## Introduction of Prithvi

## A simple example of fine-tuning
*Below to include practices of fine-tuning with 2 classes and small spatial extent*

### Preprocessing of the training datasets

#### Browsing the training dataset

#### Perform preprocessing and browse outputs

### Model training
*model training should achieve 80-90% of overall accuracy in 15-30 minutes.*

### Evaluation

### Inference
*To include applying the traind model to other regions not covered by the training dataset*

## A practical example of fine-tuning
*Below to include practices of fine-tuning with 6 classes and small spatial extent*

### Preprocessing of the training datasets

#### Browsing the training dataset

#### Perform preprocessing and browse outputs

### Model training
*model training should achieve 80-90% of overall accuracy in 15-30 minutes.*

### Evaluation

### Inference

## Detection of innacurate data in LU layers

### Inference of LU classes for a region
*To apply the trained model to other regions nearby the training dataset wiht INACCURATE LU polygon*

#### Inference

#### Browsiong outputs
*to highlight areas inconsitent between LU layer and inference result*

#### Overlay (intersect analysis) the inference result and LU layer 
*to extract area polygons with inconsistent classes between LU layer and inference result*

#### (optional) Aggregaet the area polygons by grids
*Better to visualize spatial distribution of inaccurate data in LU layers. This is to reduce visual affection of noisy/minor differences between the LU layer and inference result*
